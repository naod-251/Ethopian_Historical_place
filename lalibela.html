<h1>Lalibela</h1>
<h3>Rise to Power<h3><br>

Because Lalibela came to power during his brother's lifetime, Taddesse Tamrat suspects that he took the crown by force of arms.[5] Lalibela was backed by the nobles of the Amhara People in his power struggle against his brothers; after his victory he made Amharic Lessana Negus and installed Amhara nobles in the top positions of his kingdom.[6] Construction of Churches<br>

Lalibela is said to have seen Jerusalem in a vision and then attempted to build a new Jerusalem as his capital in response to the capture of old Jerusalem by Muslim forces led by Saladin in 1187. As such, many features of the town of Lalibela have Biblical names including the town's river, known as the River Jordan (Amharic: ዮርዳኖስ ወንዝ, romanized: Yordanos Wenz). The city remained the capital of Ethiopia from the late 12th century and into the 13th century.<br>

Details about the construction of his 11 monolithic churches at Lalibela have been lost. The later Gadla Lalibela, a hagiography of the king, states that he carved these churches out of stone with only the help of angels.[7] According to the narrative of the Portuguese embassy to Ethiopia in 1520-6, written down by Father Francisco Álvares and published in 1540, the Lalibelian priests claimed that the churches took 24 years to construct. They said that King Lalibela ordered this to be done. [8] <br></font>
